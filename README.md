# MedAssist

My project is a medical system that allows users to add, find and manage medicines and generate invoices for their customers. The system has a user-friendly interface that is designed using HTML, CSS and JS. The system also uses PHP and MySQL to handle the backend logic and database operations. The system aims to simplify the tasks of medical store owners and staff by providing them with an easy-to-use and efficient solution.
